# Intro

Back when I was first starting in web development, my first job had us learning React. Since React was what I was first learning so I was most comfortable and skilled in it, I chose React as well when it came time to make my portfolio site. This was a useful learning experience, but over the years I've learned good use cases for single-page apps vs static sites, and for this portfolio, having it be a static HTML and CSS site makes a lot more sense. So in a strange cyclical fashion, I'm now going back to the basics with this site, building it with the same tools a beginner would. It's been a good reminder to me that your tech stack doesn't have to be complicated. Stick to the traditional tech when possible and only reach for new tools on a per-need basis.

# Additional Information

### Icons

I opted to download icons as svgs then copy the svg code directly in (had to copy it directly in so that you can apply fill using css variables). This also helped to avoid downloading a bunch of unused icons.

To optimize load times and consistency, I made them all square (800x800) and .webp format.

I back up all these photos at [on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_zeYQGXOWTF6EYDtZDBi32dJSmL7dQuW?usp=drive_link).
