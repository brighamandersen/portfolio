          <p>
            Silver Fund Web App - A Stocks/Trades Performance Tracker/Predictor
            Site. I created this while working as a Software Engineer for Silver
            Fund (BYU's MBA Finance Program) during the second half of 2020.
            After I left the project broke, so I recreated the front-end side of

            For my Senior Capstone at BYU I'm on a team with 4 other developers
            working for Adobe. We specifically work on Adobe Analytics.
            Corporations like Walmart and Best Buy use it, but managers doing
            basic analytics aren't the most technical, so we've been tasked with
            enhancing their React front-end by revamping the workflow for
            building out visualizations like line and bar charts.

          <p>
            In this class at BYU, we went over several general approaches to
            algorithm design, including Divide and Conquer, Graph-based, Greedy,
            Dynamic Programming, Linear Programming, and Intelligent Search. We
            tackled projects which solved the famous traveling salesman problem,
            basic cryptography, primality testing, convex hulls, gene
            sequencing, and networking routing. See the link for project
            write-ups.

            For CS 356 UI/UX Design class at BYU, my group of 3 had to make a
            website prototype using Figma to solve a pain point. We noticed that
            coding resources are mostly geared towards experienced developers,
            so we made Hack Overflow, which simplifies resources like Stack
            Overflow and W3 Schools into an all-in-one resource.

            For BYU's CS 356 UI/UX Design class project, my group of 3 made a
            mobile app throughout the second half of the semester. We found that
            it's hard to remember people's names, and sometimes important
            details about where you two met or other relevant info about them.
            We made a Figma prototype and then a Flutter app that demos how you
            could use your GPS to locate those around you and be able to put
            names to faces.

            from a user is an essential skill to have. To practice this I
            leveraged Stripe API to make a simple prototype of how I could
            charge for my services.

            For my final project for BYU CS 356 UI/UX Design class, we had to
            make an app that fills a need for the Coloured People of South
            Africa. After doing extensive research, I found that the those
            people struggle to find their identify due to their mixed heritage.
            I made a Figma prototype of how an app could scan their face using
            facial recognition and then help them identify which facial features
            correspond with their ancestral tribes.

          <h2>Portfolio (This Website)</h2>
          <p>
            This website was made using React and styled using Material UI. It
            was built with the purpose of helping prospective clients/employers
            get a feel for who I am and the work I do. Though the site looks
            pretty simple, I've added a lot of optimizations so that images load
            quickly and there's no lag across the experience.

            visitors and wanted to be able to go in later and make adjustments
            himself, so we opted to make the site in WordPress.

            For BYU's CS 340 Software Design Patterns class, we made a Twitter
            Clone using Android on the front-end then Java and AWS (EC2, S3, API
            Gateway, Lambdas, SQS, DynamoDB) on the back-end. We learned how to
            not only make a working full-stack app, but how to design it so you
            can reuse code and follow best practice.

            International Mentoring Booking Site used by Nike and Oracle. I did
            full-stack development on this project, but focused primarily on
            front-end. This project has been unstable since I left, so in the
            cases that the Official Website
            (https://portal.villagebookbuilders.org) is down or people want to
            take a look at site features w/o making an account, I recreated the
            front-end side of things on my domain as a side project.
